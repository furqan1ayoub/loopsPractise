# Which is best?

***Method 2 (using a set) is generally considered more concise, efficient, and Pythonic.***

- Sets are specifically designed for storing unique elements, making them highly efficient for this task.
***Method 1 can be useful in situations where you need to maintain the original order of the elements in the list.***

Key Considerations:

- If maintaining the original order is crucial, use Method 1.
- For general duplicate removal and conciseness, Method 2 is preferred.
