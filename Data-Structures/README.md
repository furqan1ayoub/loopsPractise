# Python Data Structures Learning Guide

## 1. Understand the Core Concepts

- **List**: Ordered collection, may have duplicates.
- **Set**: Unordered collection, contains only unique elements.
- **Dictionary**: Stores key-value pairs, unordered.
- **Tuple**: Ordered, immutable collection.


# Visualize with Diagrams
```md
1) List: A series of ordered elements that are accessed via indexes.
2) Set: A collection where elements are unordered and unique.
3) Dictionary: A set of key-value pairs.
4) Tuple: Like a list but immutable.
```
# Use Real-World Examples
```md
- List: Shopping list, tasks that can repeat , changable  and need ordering.
- Set: Password requirements (unique, unordered,changable).
- Dictionary: Phonebook with names as keys and phone numbers as values (name(keys)-should be understandable keys can be anything).
- Tuple: GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude), which should not change but ordered i.e (long,lati) isn't true but always (lat , long ).
