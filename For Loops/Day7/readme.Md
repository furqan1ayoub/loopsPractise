# Payloads:
**A payload is just data or code that you send to a website, often with the intent of testing if thereâ€™s a security vulnerability. In hacking or security testing, a payload could be something like:**

**A small piece of malicious code (e.g., a script) designed to break something.
An input that could trigger an unexpected behavior, like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.**
For example:

`<script>alert('XSS')`</script> is a payload that, if processed wrongly by a website, could show a pop-up (alert) in the browser, which is a sign of an XSS vulnerability.
# Endpoints:
**An endpoint is just a specific part of a website or web application where you can interact with the system, like a webpage or an API (Application Programming Interface).**

***For example:

`login.php` is an endpoint where users enter their login credentials.
`search.php` is an endpoint where users can search for products.
`comment-submit` could be an endpoint where users submit comments.

- In simple terms:

### Payloads are the "test data" you send to see if you can break something.
### Endpoints are the "places" in the website or web app where data is received or processed.***
