```python
#we use nested loops when we have to -> do sth with the each iterated value like :- prime no's 
#in it we get all no's to 2 - 101 as 1 and itself isn't considered(as prime no's should be divisible by 1 and itself)
#so we iterate from 2 -99 and on each
#value we - checked through for loop is it divisble by the nos upto it i.e 2 to it and this goes on to 99 
```
