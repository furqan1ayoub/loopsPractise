## factorial of a number is the product of positive integers from 1 upto that no.
*denoted by !* 

`eg:- 5!  = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120`

### in the question-> we again consider a box where the no gets on mutliplying upto the inputUser no.

`   Like #s4: put the no in box and multiply it in each step with existing one in it..
    #eg : if 1 at beggining in it 1*1=1
    #then nextStep 2*1=2...
	#now 2 in it another no 3 gets in and mutliply ->2*3=6 <so 6 is the new Number in it and next gets in that gets mutliplied 6*4 = 24; lly 24*5.........>
	- ................likewise upto inputUser no given`
